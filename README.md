We want more to understand the virtue of expressing uncertainty and making decisions robust to uncertainty. 

Some prototypes of the game (the unity apps) are designed for high school students and can be used in teaching as well to stimulate discussions on uncertainty and never the least just for entertainment. 

Other prototypes (the shinyR apps) are designed for teaching and to initate discussions. 

We plan to continue with further developement.
